OBJECT RELATIONAL SCHEMA
An Object relational model is a combination of a Object oriented database model and a Relational database model. So, it supports objects, classes, inheritance etc. just like Object Oriented models and has support for data types, tabular structures etc. like Relational data model.

Advantages of Object Relational model
The advantages of the Object Relational model are âˆ’

Inheritance

The Object Relational data model allows its users to inherit objects, tables etc. so that they can extend their functionality. Inherited objects contains new attributes as well as the attributes that were inherited. 

Complex Data Types

Complex data types can be formed using existing data types. This is useful in Object relational data model as complex data types allow better manipulation of the data.

Extensibility

The functionality of the system can be extended in Object relational data model. This can be achieved using complex data types as well as advanced concepts of object oriented model such as inheritance.


PROBLEM 3 - 
1. use Mongo_DB_Project
2.
3. bd.createCollection('order')
   bd.createCollection('categories')
   bd.createCollection('customers')
